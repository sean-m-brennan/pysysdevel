The Integrated Modeling of Perturbation in Atmospheres for Conjunction
Tracking (IMPACT) project integrates drag modeling, orbit propagation,
and conjunction analysis to better predict collisions in orbit. This
is built on, and propels the further development of, our integration
architecture: /SysDevel/. The =sysdevel= Python package generically
aids multi-model simulation development through model coupling, data
visualization and collaborative software distribution.  We describe in
detail how /SysDevel/ handles each of these tasks, and the ongoing
challenges they present, as a case study of the IMPACT project's
integration efforts.

* Introduction

The IMPACT project has integrated atmospheric density modeling, drag
coefficient and orbit propagation, and statistical space object
conjunction analysis to better predict collisions in orbit. This
software framework not only couples these disparate models and data
sources, but can take on new data sources and, with caveats, new
models.

The /SysDevel/ architecture, implemented as the open-source Python
package =sysdevel=, is the engine behind the development of such
multi-model simulation software. This pure-python package helps in
three major areas of code development: model coupling, data
visualization, and distribution for collaboration.

We will review the role of /SysDevel/ of the IMPACT framework as a
case study, describing these three areas of development, particularly
in terms of generalizing model interactions and applying verification
and validation (V&V) techniques.


* Modeling and Simulation

The most challenging task of the IMPACT integration effort lies in
aligning the diverse data that serve as input and output for each
model such that subsequent models can use them. See Figure [[1]] below for
an overview of the various models involved, and Koller, et al. for
greater detail.\cite{koller_impact} Our options were to implement an
ad hoc solution for each model pairing or devise a generic means for
joining models. The latter approach is our /SysDevel/ architecture.

Therefore, the most conceptually interesting portion of =sysdevel= is
its model integration facility. /SysDevel/ combines multiple
simulation models together using the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
pattern, which consists of data models (in the case of IMPACT, orbital
objects), data controllers that manipulate those objects (IMPACT
modeling processes), and data views that represent direct hooks to
plotting and visualization. Notice that there is conflicting semantics
for the word 'model' above – in the context of the well-known MVC
software pattern, we will substitute the word 'object'. These objects
are the core of our model synthesis strategy.

#+END_SRC

As our development process for IMPACT iterates from 1-to-1 conjunction
analysis, expanding to all-to-all space object collision detection, we
move from the challenges of tying these models together coherently, to
the additional complexities of scale. As we expand to cover more and
more orbital objects, and over wider time scales, our storage
performance needs grow drastically. Furthermore, we are not only
concerned with scalability, but also malleability. We already have
integrated not just our own novel models \cite{walker_gas,
shoemaker_tomography, shoemaker_density}, but also some alternate
models (such as MSIS for atmospheric density). Additionally, we want
to easily include other alternatives throughout the pipeline in a more
or less automated fashion. This dynamic computational pipeline
construction allows IMPACT developers to both verify our models by
injecting observation data for comparison against predicted outcomes,
and to validate our own models against such alternates as MSIS above.

To achieve the required scalability, the =sysdevel= data object
abstraction supports multiple data storage backends. This can consist
of structured Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) files, or utilize a
relational database, or even graph databases such as Neo4J.

To satisfy the latter design requirement of malleability, the
=sysdevel= data objects are self-describing, using built-in Python
idioms. This feature allows IMPACT developers to simply alter our data
object definition (by creating a new sub-class of the original Python
data object) to also conform to the domain ontology of the new
model. Inside the =sysdevel= implementation, there is a great deal
more complexity to map that change to the storage backend (hence our
initial preference for HDF, which simplifies this mapping).

=sysdevel= also simplifies computational scaling by exposing, and
easing the configuration of, multiple parallel compute schemes: from
traditional MPI messaging to object-based, ad hoc, computational
resource discovery.


* Data Visualization

=sysdevel= provides a generic web-based user interface, using a
Javascript and PHP framework, for configuring any particular
simulation run and results viewing. Using a plumbing metaphor, the
user graphically configures the simulation processing pipeline,
choosing which data sources and processing models to use, and chooses
data plots of interest. These interactive results plots are displayed
as soon as data is available. To minimize computation, =sysdevel=
stores intermediate results, so data from a duplicate configuration is
available immediately unless caching is overridden.

#+CAPTION: IMPACT orbital visualization
#+NAME:    3
[[file:orbits.png]]

Custom visualization is easily added to this user interface, because
the framework communicates with the simulation using JSON over
WebSockets. For example, within the IMPACT source tree, one of our
sub-packages is labeled 'website' and this not only ties in to the
generic =sysdevel= interface, but also provides a three-dimensional
visualization of orbital objects about the Earth, built with
Javascript. A screen capture of this interactive visualization can be
seen in Figure [[2]]. To reduce clutter, we only display the most recent
orbital track history. Positions are streamed from our pre-computed
data from the orbit propagator as the visualization time increments.
Positional uncertainty is indicated as a statistical cloud of points,
also streamed from the backend. Depending on the power of the graphics
card available to the browser (/not/ the backend), this visualization
can support three to four thousand orbital objects.


* Collaboration and Distribution

For the sake of confirming research, it is critical to be able to
consistently recreate a complex simulation system such as IMPACT
across potentially diverse computing environments. For software
development across a large team, this capability is doubly critical.
=sysdevel= glues together a wide variety of build systems into one, in
order to facilitate building a multi-model system that, by definition,
consists of separately developed code sources, each possibly targeted
for very different environments.

The =sysdevel= build system extends the built-in Python =distutils=
package to recursively build sub-packages that each build one of our
models with a normal 'python setup.py build' call. In the case of
IMPACT, for example, this descends into the GITM sub-package like a
recursive 'make' call. It locates GITM's MPI and HDF5 library
dependencies and the proper Fortran compiler, fetching and installing
them if any are missing by utilizing CMake-style configuration files
in =sysdevel=. Finally, it creates a native executable for use in a
cluster. Those familiar with Python will recognize that this is well
beyond the normal =distutils= build process.

In addition to easing software distribution, =sysdevel= also seeks to
remedy a growing concern in academia - that of sharing and confirming
results. Whereas the literate programming (documentation embedded in
code) and the reproducible research (code embedded in documentation)
approaches directly address some of the issues involved in scientific
reproduction, these approaches do not scale well. For computational
scaling, 'cloud' computing resources appear to be a good fit, but
sharing of large-scale data has not been addressed. /SysDevel/ is an
exploration of how this issue of data scaling might be approached: a
mechanism for data-set providers to allow computation, without
necessarily providing compute resources, while maintaining control of
their data.


* Conclusion

Through these features of scalable and malleable data unification,
simulation pipeline configuration and data visualization, and a
comprehensive build system, the IMPACT framework has been able to
realize our own model V&V, as well as contribute back to the research
community by providing tools at several levels - namely both pluggable
collision-analysis, and generic multi-model integration tools.

Our =sysdevel= integration package not only serves the needs of our
IMPACT project, but also provides a general tool for other multi-model
simulations that would otherwise require extensive effort to tie
together, particularly for Big Data providers.

There are, of course, many ongoing challenges in realizing the
/SysDevel/ concept in full. The complexity of environment discovery
for the build system is particularly challenging and is only truly
testable through crowd-source techniques.
