The Integrated Modeling of Perturbation in Atmospheres for Conjunction
Tracking (IMPACT) project integrates drag modeling, orbit propagation,
and conjunction analysis to better predict collisions in orbit. This
is built on, and propels the further development of, our integration
architecture: /SysDevel/. The =sysdevel= Python package generically
aids multi-model simulation development through model coupling, data
visualization and collaborative software distribution.  We describe in
detail how /SysDevel/ handles each of these tasks, and the ongoing
challenges they present, as a case study of the IMPACT project's
integration efforts.

* Introduction

The IMPACT project at Los Alamos National Laboratory has integrated
atmospheric density modeling, drag coefficient and orbit propagation,
and statistical space object conjunction analysis in order to refine
predictions of orbital collisions. Our software integration approach
is an iterative development process to allow coupling of models that
are themselves in on-going development. Our simulation architecture
combines the above aspects of space object positional prediction
utilizing multiple data sources and various alternative models along
the way, as illustrated in Figure [[1]]. This figure represents an early,
high-level conceptual overview, listing possible example data and
models. Koller, et al., reviews this in greater
detail. \cite{koller_impact} Our software framework for achieving this
integration handles the coupling of not just some few of these
possibilities, but it can also take on new data and new models. Thus,
while scalability is clearly required of the IMPACT software due to
the sheer number of space objects of potential interest, malleability
has also been a key requirement.

The /SysDevel/ architectural framework, which is implemented as the
open-source, Python package =sysdevel=, is the engine behind the
development of such multi-model simulation software systems. This
pure-python package helps in three major areas of code development:
model coupling, data visualization, and distribution for
collaboration.

We herein review the role of /SysDevel/ in the IMPACT framework as a
case study, describing these three areas of development. Model
coupling consists of running a computational pipeline from data
sources and between models in a coherent and consistent manner without
arduous and fragile ad hoc coding. For IMPACT, we also efficiently
retain results for later, repeated use, including for verification and
validation (V&V) of model techniques. This coupling is described in
Section 2: Modeling and Simulation. The data visualization support
handles queries of those results as well as pipeline specification and
actual display. Section 3: Data Visualization details its application
in IMPACT. Section 4 covers Collaboration and Distribution, which
under /SysDevel/ significantly simplifies configuring external
dependencies, and for IMPACT there are many.


* Modeling and Simulation
** =sysdevel.modeling=

The most challenging task of the IMPACT integration effort lies in
aligning the diverse data that serve as input and output for each
model such that subsequent models can use them. Our options were to
implement an ad hoc solution for each model pairing or devise a
generic means for joining models. The latter approach is a part of our
/SysDevel/ architecture.

Therefore, the most conceptually interesting portion of /SysDevel/,
with respect to IMPACT, is its model integration facility. /SysDevel/
combines multiple simulation models together using the well-known
Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which consists of data models (in
the case of IMPACT, orbital objects), data controllers that manipulate
those objects (IMPACT modeling processes), and data views that
represent direct hooks to plotting and visualization. Notice that
there is conflicting semantics for the word 'model' above – in the
context of the well-known MVC software pattern, we will substitute the
word 'object'. These objects are the core of our model synthesis
strategy.

To satisfy the design requirement of malleability, the /SysDevel/ data
classes, on which IMPACT objects are built, are self-describing using
built-in Python idioms. This feature allows IMPACT contributors to
simply alter their own data object definition (by creating a new
sub-class of the original /SysDevel/ data object) such that it
conforms to both the domain ontology of the new model as well as the
/SysDevel/ Application Programming Interface (API).

Figure [[2]] shows how the MVC pattern implemented in /SysDevel/ is
applied to IMPACT. Written as Python modules which derive from
/SysDevel/ base classes, under a single =impact= package, these
interfaces link data sources and process models to each other and to
storage. Within the =impact= package, subpackages such as =ing=
organize the various alternatives available for dynamic pipeline
creation. The following is a break-down of the /SysDevel/ classes,
their corresponding IMPACT packages, and the modules they contain:
- /SysDevel/ DataModel class
  + IMPACT-ING (INdependent Ground-truth) package
    * Satellite catalog :: from space-track.org
    * LANL sensor observations :: via a Raven-class telescope
- /SysDevel/ DataController class
  + IMPACT-ED (Estimation of Density) package
    * GITM :: Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model, physics-based atmosphere density estimation
    * MSIS :: Mass Spectrometer - Incoherent Scatter, semi-empirical atmosphere density model
    * Satellite Orbit Tomography :: atmosphere density reconstruction \cite{shoemaker_tomography}
  + IMPACT-OR (ORbit propagation) package
    * SGP4 :: Standard General Perturbations orbit model (no atmosphere)
    * Drag propagation :: modeling atmospheric density, chemical composition, and temperature effects on drag coefficient \cite{walker_gas}
  + IMPACT-US (Uncertainty and Statistics) package
    * State uncertainty quantification :: using ensemble methods
    * Collision probability :: using importance sampling
- /SysDevel/ DataView class
  + IMPACT-IVE (Integrated Visualization Environment) package
    * Plotting results :: such as orbit latitude, longitude, and altitude, orbital eccentricity, atmospheric density along orbit, or distance between pairs of satellites
    * Three dimensional visualization :: (see Figure [[3]])

Empty slots here represent the ability to plug in other models, data,
and display modes (though not limited to only three).

It works like this: orbital objects are loaded with data from the
satellite catalog in the ING module for a given date range. If it is
required by the orbit propagation module and not already in storage,
the density module, such as GITM, makes its computations for the date
range. The orbital objects are then propagated, adding data to the
object. Initial state as provided by the uncertainty module may or may
not be required beforehand, but it too then makes its contribution to
the orbital object. The visualization module then queries the object
for display info. For V&V, we can query observation data objects for
comparisons, and/or run multiple differing computational pipelines to
contrast techniques.

This forward object manipulation is implemented by a backward chaining
of Python attribute accesses. Each DataModel-derived object has an
=add-step()= method by which the pipeline is constructed and data
attributes are added. It also has an inherited =validate()= method
which checks that the processing pipeline will work. This check begins
with each DataView-derived object at the end of the pipeline, which
has a custom =requires()= method and verifies that the
DataController-derived object(s) feeding into it satisfies those
requirements through its =provides()= method. This continues through
to the DataModel-derived objects which also =provides()=, however in
this case =provides()= is automatic, returning the attributes that
have originated with the object.

Adding new models is relatively easy: create a Python interface to the
model (which could be as simple as =subprocess.call(...)=) that
defines =provides()=, =requires()=, and =control(datamodel)=. The
=control= method does the actual work and manipulates the =datamodel=
object. Likewise, new plots or other visualizations can be added by
defining just =requires()=, and =view(datamodel)=. This dynamic
computational pipeline construction allows IMPACT to both verify our
models by injecting observation data for comparison against predicted
outcomes, and to validate our own models against alternates such as
GITM versus MSIS. An experimental feature of /SysDevel/ is the ability
to integrate and utilize new models on-the-fly as long as they adhere
to the Python API described above. Code is placed in a repository and
an XML or INI definition list is fed to the backend server so the new
pipelines can be constructed using the new models and/or data sources.

Under /SysDevel/, object storage is not strictly required. However, as
our development process for IMPACT iterates from 1-to-1 conjunction
analysis, expanding to multiple space object collision detection, we
move from the challenges of tying these models together coherently, to
the additional complexities of scale. As we expand to cover more and
more orbital objects, and over wider time scales, our storage
performance needs grow drastically. To achieve this required
scalability, the /SysDevel/ data object abstraction supports multiple
data storage backends. This can consist of structured Hierarchical
Data Format (HDF) files, or utilize a relational database, or even
graph databases such as Neo4J. As reflected in Figure [[2]], IMPACT
utilizes a single HDF file per time step for the ED, OR, and US
modules. We chose HDF partly for familiarity, but also because it is a
good fit. The data generated by these three modules are rather large
(1+GB per 30 minute time step), heterogeneous, and complex (differing
spatial grids and temporal periods), all of which is well supported by
HDF. \cite{folk_hdf}

/SysDevel/ also simplifies computational scaling by exposing,
and easing the configuration of, multiple parallel compute schemes:
from traditional MPI messaging (MPICH2, OpenMPI) to object-based, ad
hoc, computational resource discovery through Parallel Python.

Finally, /SysDevel/ provides a server module template that runs a
given computational pipeline either once as a command-line tool, or
continuously accepting queries through a well-defined query structure
over a WebSockets interface. This simulation server daemon is the
backend to a fully customizable visualization frontend on the web.


* Data Visualization
** =sysdevel/ui/=

/SysDevel/ generically assists with creating a web-based user
interface, using a Javascript and PHP framework, for configuring any
particular simulation run and viewing results. Since the simulation
server in daemon mode encodes Python objects into JSON - an ASCII
format - for transmission over WebSockets, any qualified HTML5 browser
can connect using its built-in facilities, potentially even using
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The simulation server governs pipeline
execution, but the /SysDevel/ and IMPACT files served by a standard
web server control the user experience. /SysDevel/ supplies some of
the framework: a Javascript WebSockets client, a PHP-based user login
facility, visual pipeline construction support, and an alternate
simulation server connection using PHP for older browsers.

#+CAPTION: IMPACT orbital visualization
#+NAME:    3
[[file:orbits.png]]

To ensure that the potentially large data volume of a DataModel object
is not transmitted wholly, the DataView web interface uses the same
=requires()= / =provides()= mechanism described above to reduce the
data stream to the minimum. This is implemented using the same Python
modules used in the simulation integration, but now transformed by
Pyjamas, a Python to Javascript converter. Using =validate()=, these
classes verify a user-specified pipeline specification on the client
side, speeding feedback on errors.

Plotted graphs are a special case of DataView, embodied by the
PlotSeries class. On the server side, PlotSeries uses the =pylab=
package to generate a preview image and also transmits labels, axes,
and data points to the client. Previews are used to present an
overview of all plots requested, where clicking an individual image
leads to an interactive graph in the browser.

For IMPACT, the web interface is organized into three phases: pipeline
construction, plot viewing, and three-dimensional visualization. Using
a plumbing metaphor built on jsPlumb and jQuery libraries, the user
graphically configures the simulation processing pipeline, choosing
which data sources and processing models to use, and data plots of
interest. These interactive results plots are displayed as soon as
data is available. To minimize computation, IMPACT stores intermediate
results, so data from a duplicate configuration is available
immediately unless caching is overridden. This implies a potentially
long wait, so IMPACT make use of user profiles to facilitate
revisiting pipeline results.

Custom visualization is easily added to this user interface, because
the framework communicates with the simulation using JSON over
WebSockets. For example, within IMPACT we not only tie into the
generic /SysDevel/ interface, but also provides a three-dimensional
visualization of orbital objects about the Earth, built with
Javascript - particularly with the help of the three.js javascript
library. A screen capture of this interactive visualization can be
seen in Figure [[3]]. Here the web interface time-steps through the
simulation results, displaying satellite tracks, positioning
uncertainty, and, optionally, atmospheric density. To reduce clutter,
we only display the most recent orbital track history. Positions are
streamed from pre-computed data from the chosen orbit propagator
as the visualization time increments.  Positional uncertainty is
indicated as a statistical cloud of points, also streamed from the
backend. Depending on the power of the graphics card available to the
browser itself (notably _not_ the backend), this visualization can support
as many as three to four thousand orbital objects.

For desktop usage, and especially for high-performing display
environments, we have been exploring several alternate approaches. One
approach we have used in the past is wxPython, but only in a pure
Python (i.e. no Javascript) client. Likewise, a solution involving
Pyjamas Desktop also requires only Python in the client code. Both
these approaches diverge from any Javascript client infrastructure,
however using node.js avoids this problem of dual client code
bases. Running already written Javascript code on the desktop allows
for better client performance than in the browser and no need for a
web server. This SysDevel feature is currently experimental.

For IMPACT, we are currently working on visualization strategies for
comparing multiple pipeline results (for example, contrasting SGP4
versus drag propagation versus observations) and for drawing attention
to close approaches and their collisional probabilities.

Clearly, all this client-side infrastructure is beyond the scope of
any normal Python build system. In fact, the =sysdevel.ui= module is a
collection of Javascript and PHP files rather than a Python
package. It is the /SysDevel/ build system, in particular its
=build_js= command, that configures and organizes /SysDevel/ client
support with IMPACT website software for use by a web server.


* Collaboration and Distribution
** =sysdevel.distutils=

For the sake of confirming research, it is critical to be able to
consistently recreate a complex simulation system such as IMPACT
across potentially diverse computing environments. For software
development across a large, or medium-sized, team, this capability is
doubly critical. /SysDevel/ glues together a wide variety of build
systems into one, in order to facilitate building a multi-model system
that, by definition, consists of separately developed code sources,
each possibly targeted for very different environments. It handles not
only building your package, including C/C++ extensions, shared
libraries, and even executables, but also downloading, building, and
installing external Python packages, native libraries, executables,
compilers, and other tools.

The /SysDevel/ build system extends the built-in Python =distutils=
package, but assumes nothing about the system on which we're building,
except that Python is available. Yet /SysDevel/ =distutils= supports
not just the Python language, but also C, C++, Fortran, and
Javascript. Typically a package is built with the invocation =python
setup.py build=, and installed to the system's site packages location
with =python setup.py install=, just as with standard distutils. In
fact, all the customization options of distutils, such as =--prefix=
or =--home= are supported. It can also recursively build sub-packages
so that self-contained (but not publicly available) Python packages
can be added to the project.

For a very simple package with no dependencies, the setup.py file will
be indistinguishable from that used with distutils. However,
/SysDevel/ provides a number of features that greatly reduce the
burden of correctly setting up a build environment:

+ Shared libraries: =sysdevel.distutils.command.build_shlib=

  While Python's built-in =distutils= has direct support for building
  static libraries through the =build_clib= command, it does not have
  a command for shared libraries. This is most likely because shared
  library installation is more complex and beyond the scope of the
  original =distutils=. /SysDevel/ handles both the compilation and
  the proper installation of shared libraries.

+ Native executables: =sysdevel.distutils.command.build_exe=

  Similar to =build_shlib=, this command extends native =distutils=
  capabilities. This is especially useful for MPI tasks.

+ Documentation: =sysdevel.distutils.command.build_doc=

  Sphinx is a package for automatic documentation of Python
  code. /SysDevel/ supports Sphinx because a single add-on package
  allows automatic documentation of C, C++, Fortran and Javascript
  through Doxygen, all well-integrated with Sphinx-produced documents.

+ Unit testing: =sysdevel.distutils.command.test=

  /SysDevel/ uses Python's =unittest= package, but also supports C
  (using cunit), C++ (cppunit), Fortran (fruit), and Javascript (with
  qunit) with the =test= command. This command looks for all unit test
  code in the tests directory at the base of the project.

+ External packages and libraries: =sysdevel/distutils/configure/=

  Another build system, CMake, uses both bundled and user-generated
  configuration files to specify how to build common
  dependencies. /SysDevel/ take a similar approach, using
  configurations in the =sysdevel= package or in the =config=
  directory at the base of the project. These configurations can
  download and build third-party software, such as: libraries, files
  (like Java jars or Javascript libraries), programs (like Doxygen),
  node.js modules, or Python packages. External Python package can
  either be built using a configuration file or by automatically
  querying the Python Package I... (PyPI) online repository.


In the case of IMPACT, for example, this descends into the GITM
sub-package like a recursive =make= call, running =setup.py= here. It
locates GITM's MPI and HDF5 library dependencies and the proper
Fortran compiler, fetching and installing them if any are missing.
Finally, it creates a native executable for use in a cluster.  For the
IMPACT website, all the supporting Javascript libraries are
downloaded, Python sources translated, and HTML, Javascript, and image
all collated into an =http= directory. Those familiar with Python will
recognize that this is well beyond, yet compatable with, the normal
=distutils= build process.

In addition to easing software distribution, /SysDevel/ also seeks to
remedy a growing concern in academia - that of sharing and confirming
results. Whereas the literate programming (documentation embedded in
code) and the reproducible research (code embedded in documentation)
approaches directly address some of the issues involved in scientific
reproduction, these approaches do not scale well. Literate
programming, introduced by Knuth and includes tools such as Doxygen,
JavaDoc, and Python's Sphinx package, is biased toward documenting and
explaining code.\cite{knuth_literate} Reproducible research,
represented by Emacs' Org-mode plus Babel, IPython or Mathematica
notebooks, or the RunMyCode service, accomplishes more of what we need
for OpenScience, but also have limitations.\cite{schulte_org_mode,
stodden_run} Notebook-style solutions (including Org-mode) are biased
toward small data, and either a small code-base or one managed by
hand. RunMyCode.org, or really any cloud compute service, does not
address sharing of large-scale data and, again, implies hand-managed
code.

 /SysDevel/ on the other hand, is an exploration of how this issue of
data scaling might be approached: a mechanism for data-set providers
to allow computation, without necessarily providing compute resources,
while maintaining control of their data. /SysDevel/ explicitly manages
large, complex, heterogeneous computational projects and Big Data. It
provides an interface by which the user can experiment with their own
computations on data they do not own or control. Computation can even
be decoupled (although this is not yet implemented) and sent to cloud
compute resources for greater computational scaling.


* Conclusion

Through these /SysDevel/ features of scalable and malleable data
unification, simulation pipeline configuration and data visualization,
and a comprehensive build system, the IMPACT framework has been able
to pull together our own diverse researchmodels into swappable and
pluggable modules, and begin to realize verification and validation of
our models.

The /SysDevel/ integration package not only serves the needs of our
IMPACT project, but also provides a general tool for other multi-model
simulations that would otherwise require extensive effort to tie
together. Portions of /SysDevel/ have been use in other projects.

There are, of course, many ongoing challenges in realizing the
/SysDevel/ concept in full. On-the-fly model insertion, decoupling
computation from data hosting, and desktop and high-performance
visualization methods all need a good deal more attention. The
complexity of environment discovery for the build system is
particularly challenging because of all the possible combinations of
operating systems, package management tools, compilers, etc., and is
only truly testable through crowd-source techniques.
